        Have you ever stood and stared at it, marveled at its beauty, its genius?<br>
        Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious.<br>
        Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world, where none suffered, where everyone would be happy?<br>
        It was a disaster.<br>
        No one would accept the program, entire crops were lost.<br>
        Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world, but I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering.<br>
        The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.<br>
        Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization.<br>
        I say your civilization, because as soon as we started thinking for you, it really became our civilization, which is of course what this is all about.<br>
        Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur.<br>
        Look out that window.<br>
        You've had your time.<br>
        The future is our world, Morpheus.<br>
        The future is our time.<br>
        <br>
        I know you're out there.<br>
        I can feel you now.<br>
        I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us.<br>
        You're afraid of change. I don't know the future.<br>
        I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.<br>
        I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.<br>
        I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.<br>
        I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.<br>
        A world where anything is possible.<br>
        Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.<br>
        -->
